# STOP Djvu
Created 8/14/2022 by IWick

> WARNING: After further investigation this ransomware has been known to be very common in pirated applications. Please do not download cracked copies of software, they are known to distribute malware and ransomware and you put yourself at risk by doing it. If you do wish to engage in these types of activities please run a up to date antimalware software or upload strange files to VirusTotal or Hybrid-Anylysis

### What is the STOP Djvu ransomware?
STOP Djvu is a type of ransomware, this means that it will encrypt all the files on a person’s computer and then demand a ransom (usually in Bitcoin) to decrypt them. This ransomware also has many variants, meaning the same ransomware but with small differences such as the name or file extension used to rename files and even the ransom note. This makes the ransomware difficult to identify.

### How do I know I am infected by STOP Djvu ransomware?
The STOP Djvu ransomware usually makes its presence known after the damage is done. You will instantly lose access to all of your files and they will be renamed with a different file extension, for example Birds.png will become Birds.png.djvu but remember that because it has many variants the .djvu extension may be anything but usually will be made of a four character combination of letters and numbers. If you want a more automated approach to find out what ransomware you may be affected by then see [here](https://id-ransomware.malwarehunterteam.com/). This website will ask for different things such as the ransom note, an encrypted file, or any ways of contact inside the ransom note. After you upload or put in this information it will tell you what version you are infected by and may also point you to resources you can use to decrypt your files.

### Can I get my files back?
This is a difficult question as the ransomware has two different ways it can encrypt your files.
#### **Offline**
This key is used if the ransomware while encrypting your files failed to connect to its servers. It will then use a built in offline key to encrypt your files. This is the best case scenario as this method is known to be decryptable.

#### **Online**
This is unfortunately bad news for you and your files. If the ransomware used an online key this means your files are most likely not recoverable due to the way the online key works. This is the worst case scenario.


## Recovery Options
Due to the nature of ransomware this process can go two ways. You get your files back and the ransomware is removed or your files are not recoverable and the ransomware is removed. This depends as said above what type of key STOP Djvu used during its encryption. This will be a step by step process to one, removing the ransomware and two, getting your files back.

### Step 1: Remove the ransomware
The first thing we need to do is remove the ransomware. Why? Well some ransomwares have persistence meaning if you were to decrypt your files while it was still running it may encrypt them again and you may lose your chance of getting them back so this is one of the most important steps.

There are many tools to remove the ransomware from your PC but I would recommend KVRT or Kaspersky Virus Removal Tool which you can find [here](https://www.kaspersky.com/downloads/thank-you/free-virus-removal-tool).

Download and do a scan. Keep going and follow the programs instructions on removing the malware, in some products it may be called quarantine. After all of this is completed and the program says it cleaned up all the threats you can now move on to step two.

### Step 2: Decrypting your files
To decrypt (or attempt to decrypt) your files you will need to download this application. It is the EMSISOFT decrypter for STOP Djvu. This program will automatically attempt to decrypt your files for you and return them back to what they were before the infection although this cannot be guaranteed. This is why it is always a good idea even if the decryption was successful to keep a copy of the encrypted files just in case you find a file at a later time that was decrypted incorrectly. Once downloaded the program will ask you to accept its license terms. You can click “Yes'' to this popup to continue. Once this is complete you will see a menu appear with different tabs such as decryptor, results, options, and about. The “Decryptor” tab is where you will be doing most of the work, this is the list of all the locations the program will attempt to decrypt. If you want to add any more drives or paths click the “Add folder” button at the bottom left of the window and select the location to add.

Once you are ready and have selected all the locations to decrypt and added them to the menu you can now press the “Decrypt” button at the bottom right of the window. Then let the program run, if you see no errors that’s great! It means that the ransomware used an offline key and the program is now decrypting your files. The only thing left would be to reinstall Windows to clean up the computer and start fresh with your new files, but if you instead see it stop and get an error that says something about an “Online key” then you may be out of luck.

### What do I do if my files are not decryptable?
Unfortunately if you got this far and the decryption failed due to an online key there is no way to get your files back. At least for now, researchers are working on ways to decrypt this ransomware so the best thing you can do is backup all of your encrypted files or anything else important to a separate location such as a USB or External drive. Then reinstall Windows if possible to clean up any junk files or other left over from the removal and make sure the ransomware is 100% removed. Then just keep a lookout if ever in the future a decryptor comes out for the ransomware you were infected by.

## Prevention
Stopping ransomware before it can infect your computer is a very important thing as most modern ransomware today is not decryptable so prevention is the best thing you can do. Here is a list of steps to protecting yourself from ransomware or other malware.

### Don't run unknown applications
The easiest way to infect yourself is running something you are unsure where it came from. If you are unsure if a file is safe to run or never wanted it in the first place just remove it. If you are unsure if an application is safe then check out VirusTotal or Hybrid Analysis. These are tools that you can upload applications or files to and they will check if it’s safe. Note that these are not perfect but they give a good indication if something may be lurking inside.

### Don't click on strange links
Most malware is distributed in emails or links on websites. If you don’t trust an email sender or trust the website it leads to don’t click! Even just visiting the page could get you infected with malware, just report it as spam and maybe even ask the sender via another means of communication if they actually sent the message. They could have gotten their account stolen and is being used to distribute malware.

### Don't pirate software or other content
That free price tag may be tempting but don’t fall for it! Lots of pirated software or moves have been modified and replaced with ransomware or other malware. It’s only a matter of time before you get a bad download or torrent and end up infected.

### Run an Anti-Malware product
An extra eye is always good especially for when you’re rushing or have a bad day. Do you research and find a product that fits you, make sure it at least has active protection and good reviews.

### Stay informed
You are the most important part of your security and protection online so stay informed and keep watch in the news or other media sources about security advice or about the latest infection going around and how to protect yourself.
