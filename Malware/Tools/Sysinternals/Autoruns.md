> How to use the Autoruns application by Microsoft in Sysinternals to find and disable startup items

## What is it?
Autoruns is an application in the Sysinternals toolkit that will list startup items on a Windows computer.
It also shows startup applications you would not normally see in something like task manager for example startup
items in task scheduler will be shown as well including explorer hooks and more. This will allow you to really see
what's starting up on your machine.

## How can I use it?
Autoruns is something thatâ€™s easy in concept but to actually use it requires a bit of Windows knowledge, essentially
on the main screen it will show you a category header (or where the startup item is located for example a registry location)
then below will contain all the items listed with checkboxes to the left of each item. If it is checked that means the item is active
if not, then the item is not active, for a quick suggestion when working with Autoruns try to just uncheck options instead of deleting then
to make troubleshooting easy if you end up needing it later.

Some common colors you will see when looking of the listed items are
- **Yellow** This means the item the startup entry points to does not exist
- **Red** This means the item the startup entry points to is not verified

To hide all Microsoft entries (or operating system startup items) go into the "Options" tab on the top bar and check "Hide Microsoft Entries"

## Some warnings
Great power comes with great responsibility and Autoruns is no exception so here are some things to keep in mind when using Autoruns
- **If you don't know what it is, don't disable it**
    - You can easily break applications by disabling their startup item, so if you don't know what it is, don't disable it.
- **Never delete anything, only uncheck / disable**
    - Deleting something is permanent, disabling it is not, so don't delete anything as undoing it will be very difficult especially if it broke something.
- **Do not remove anything that is related to Windows and Microsoft**
    - If you don't hide Microsoft entries you can easily break Windows by for example disabling the startup of explorer.
