# Hybrid Analysis
Created 8/14/2022 by IWick

## Description
Hybrid-Analysis is another online tool similar to Virus-Total but improved and/or expanded upon. Hybrid-Analysis uses a sandbox alongside Virus-Total results to deliver a more accurate result or just give more context for the user to decide. It has the same downsides as Virus-Total with lots of false positives for some completely innocent files but is a step above with its sandbox that delivers a exportable log of all the activities of the application so users can judge it better.
