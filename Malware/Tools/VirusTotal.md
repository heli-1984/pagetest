# VirusTotal
Created 8/14/2022 by IWick

## Description
Virus-Total (now owned by Google) is a scanning utility to statically analyze a file by scanning it with a bunch of Anti-Malware products. The sense is that if you can get a group analysis of a file you can make better, more informed decisions about the file.

## Downside
Unfortunately due to the large number of scanners (and not exactly reputable ones) a lot of false positives make it through the system that make it difficult to determine for sure if a file is malicious or not. The best rule for using Virus-Total effectively is to follow a simple set of steps. If the detection amount is less than 5 it is most likely a false positive. If the engines detecting the file are unreputable or unknown, do some more digging outside of Virus-Total. Take a less precedence in trusting the “Next Generation” AI power antimalware software, these do work at blocking threats but have MANY false positives to the point where they can become ineffective.
