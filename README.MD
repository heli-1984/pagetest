# Technical Guides
Welcome to the technical guides git repository. This projectâ€™s goal is to build a database of community made writeups and informational guides about anything technical.

## Categories
Each folder in this repo is a category within the guides list, so for example the Malware folder would have malware writeups, tools, etc. There can also be subcategories so look out for that.

## Contributing
To contribute a writeup just submit a pull request and someone will look it over and add it if it fits. Make sure you add it to the correct category or make one if one does not apply. Make sure to also check out the guidelines and template for how to format and what content your writeup should contain.
