# Guidelines
We want to keep this repo as clean as possible and easy for people to access and find information quickly. If you can answer yes to all these questions, then youâ€™re most likely already ready to submit your guide for addition to this repo. And always, thank you for contributing!
- Can my guide be easily understood by someone who does not know the topic at hand?
- Is all the information in the guide easy to find with a good headers?
- The guide contains no offensive or vulgar content?
- Does my guide follow the Guide Template?

## Headers
When making a guide make sure that each of your headers is well formed and formatted correctly with a clear and concise name to make sure its easy to know exactly what you will be reading in that section.

## Links to external content
Links are great as they allow people to quickly find exactly what you are talking about such as a tool and to make sure they get the right thing however if your link is to a direct download (aka the link instead of going somewhere just immediately downloads a file without user interaction), please make sure you make the text containing the link is informative to the user so they know what they are going to be taken to without clicking the link.
